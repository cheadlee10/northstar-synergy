## GROWTH SCENARIOS

### SCENARIO 1: Conservative (Base Case)
**Assumption:** Only Scalper grows, John stays at $0

#### Month 1 (March 2026)
- Scalper trading: $1,000/week (58% growth from $632)
- John Fiverr: $0 (still ramping)
- Revenue: $1,000/week
- Costs: $50/week (stable)
- **Net: $950/week**

#### Month 2 (April 2026)
- Scalper: $1,200/week (V8 optimized)
- John Fiverr: $100/week (first gigs posted, early sales)
- Revenue: $1,300/week
- Costs: $60/week (slight increase)
- **Net: $1,240/week**

#### Month 3+ (May+ 2026)

- Revenue: $2,100/week
- Costs: $70/week
- **Net: $2,030/week (50% of goal)**

**Conservative verdict:** Doesn't hit $4K/week without John scaling faster or new streams

---

- Revenue: $4,200/week
- **Net: $4,100/week ✅ GOAL HIT**

**Timeline:** 5 months to $4K/week

---

### SCENARIO 3: Aggressive (Upside Case)
**Assumption:** All agents execute perfectly + new revenue streams

#### Month 1-3 (March-May)
- Scalper: $1,200/week (arbitrage + snipes)
- John Fiverr: $500/week (fast execution, viral gig)

- John Fiverr: $1,500/week (100+ jobs/day, price increase)
- John Website: $1,200/week (premium clients)
- Cliff: $500/week (full-time job started + consulting)
- Revenue: $5,400/week
- **Net: $5,300/week 🚀 EXCEEDS GOAL BY 33%**

**Timeline:** 5 months to $5.3K/week
**Aggressive verdict:** Possible but requires all planets to align

---

## FINANCIAL DRIVERS (What Moves the Needle)

### Scalper's P&L Levers
- **Capital deployed:** More capital = higher position sizes = higher P&L (if same edge %)
- **Edge improvement:** V8 accuracy goes from 68% → 72% = 5% P&L boost
- **Trade frequency:** Weather markets resolve 2x/day; crypto 5x/day; sports 1x/day
- **Arbitrage opportunities:** Risk-free 2% returns; 10 trades/day = $200/day baseline

**Impact:** +$500/week = $26K/year

### John's Scaling Levers
- **Gig volume:** 20 jobs/day → 50 → 100 = exponential growth
- **Average price:** $5 → $12 (as rating improves) = 140% revenue boost
- **Price + volume:** $5×20 = $100 → $12×100 = $1,200 (12x growth)
- **Website premium:** 2-3 high-ticket clients at $2K-5K each = $500-2K/week

**Impact:** +$1,000-2,000/week = $52K-104K/year

### Cliff's Levers
- **Job search:** Director-level procurement role at $150K = ~$1,000/week after taxes (if Craig takes)
- **Consulting:** 5 hours/month at $200/hr = ~$250/week (skill monetization)
- **Dashboard/SaaS:** If NorthStar dashboard becomes product = recurring revenue

**Impact:** +$500-1,000/week = $26K-52K/year

---

## CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY

**Question:** How should Craig allocate limited resources (time + capital) to hit $4K/week?

### Conservative Allocation (Minimize Risk)
- **Scalper:** 50% (improve V8, implement arbitrage, grow capital to $15K)
- **John:** 40% (push Fiverr hard; website is secondary)
- **Cliff:** 10% (job search on the side; no new products)
- **Expected outcome:** $2-2.5K/week in 4-5 months

### Moderate Allocation (Balanced)
- **Scalper:** 40% (maintain V8, add arbitrage module)
- **John:** 50% (primary growth engine; Fiverr + website)
- **Cliff:** 10% (job search + infrastructure)
- **Expected outcome:** $3.5-4K/week in 4-5 months ← **RECOMMENDED**

### Aggressive Allocation (Maximum Growth)
- **Scalper:** 30% (maintenance mode only)
- **John:** 60% (go all-in on Fiverr + website)
- **Cliff:** 10% (infrastructure + job search)
- **Risk:** Trading P&L drops if neglected; upside if John executes
- **Expected outcome:** $4.5-5.5K/week in 5-6 months (if John succeeds)

**Recommendation:** Moderate allocation with weekly check-ins. If John hits $800+ by week 6, shift more resources to him.

---

## BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS

**When does NorthStar become self-sustaining?**

- **Current:** $582/week net
- **Cost ceiling:** API tokens + infrastructure = $70-100/week
- **Breakeven:** Already achieved ✅ (profitable from day 1)

**When does it hit $4K/week?**
- Conservative: 5 months (June)
- Moderate: 5 months (July)
- Aggressive: 5 months (July)

**Key insight:** Timeline doesn't change much between scenarios. The difference is WHICH revenue streams hit $4K, not WHEN.

## RISK ANALYSIS

### Downside Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Scalper's V8 breaks | Low (15%) | -$600/week | Rollback to v7, diversify with arbitrage |
| John's Fiverr doesn't scale | Medium (35%) | -$1K/week | Website + consulting as fallback |
| Kalshi shut down/banned | Very Low (5%) | -$800/week | Move to Polymarket + sports books |
| Token costs spike | Low (20%) | -$100/week | Switch to Haiku, reduce heartbeat |
| Craig loses job motivation | Medium (30%) | -$300/week | Job search yields replacement income |

**Net risk-adjusted expectation:** $3.5-4.2K/week (accounting for 25-30% probability of downside)

---

## UPSIDE OPPORTUNITIES

### Unlocked Revenue (If...)
- **If Cliff lands director job:** +$1K/week (procurement salary divided by weekly)
- **If John's website goes viral:** +$2K/week (high-ticket clients)
- **If Scalper's arbitrage scales:** +$500-1K/week (risk-free)
- **If Craig licenses NorthStar framework:** +$0-1K/week (passive, long-term)

**Upside ceiling:** $7-8K/week (if 3+ of above happen)

---

## NEXT STEPS (For Craig)

1. **Decide capital allocation** (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
2. **Set weekly metrics** (track Scalper + John + Cliff against model)
3. **Weekly review** (did reality match model? adjust parameters)
4. **Reforecast monthly** (update baseline as actual data comes in)
5. **Pivot quickly** (if one stream underperforms, shift resources)

## Financial Tracking (Weekly Check-in Template)

```
WEEK [#]:
- Scalper P&L: $XXX (budget: $800 for Week 1)
- John Fiverr: $XXX (budget: $0 Week 1, $100 Week 2+)
- Cliff income: $XXX
- Total costs: $XXX
- **Net: $XXX (target: $950/week)**

Variance from model: +/- $XX
Biggest win: [what worked?]
Biggest miss: [what didn't?]
Next week priority: [what to fix?]
```

## Excel Model Available

I can build a dynamic Excel model with:
- Sensitivity analysis (what if each driver changes 10%?)
- Break-even calculator (how many Fiverr jobs to hit $1K/week?)
- Monthly rolling forecast (update actuals, recalculate)
- Agent performance dashboard (Scalper vs John vs Cliff side-by-side)

Request: Let me know if you want detailed Excel model built.
