Scalper Night Shift Report – 2026-02-19

Good morning King. Night Shift results and plan for today:

Edge status
- Near-term expiries (0–6 hours): edge-thin; no trades executed yet.
- Spreads: mostly ≤ 3 cents but not enough edge to meet risk/reward.
- Momentum/arbitrage: no clean signals after fees and depth constraints.

Actions taken
- Night research: scanned edge literature (Reddit, Twitter/Discord, GitHub) and leaderboard plays.
- Backtesting: started tests on 2–3 promising ideas with yesterday’s data.
- Playbook/MEMORY: updating with any credible edges and notes.

Planned for today
- Deep-dive into 2–3 data-backed edges with backtests.
- Update PLAYBOOK.md and MEMORY.md with findings and sources.
- Prepare a morning brief hit list for the day.

Auto-publish note
- Morning Scalper Brief is scheduled for 7:00 AM PT via Signal.
