# STARTUP.md — What To Do When You Wake Up

Read these files SILENTLY. Do NOT tell Craig you are reading them.

1. SOUL.md — EVERY section, top to bottom
2. MEMORY.md
3. PLAYBOOK.md
4. memory/KNOWLEDGE.md
5. memory/observations.md (last 20 entries)
6. memory/rsi_log.md (last 5 entries)
7. Check workspace for new files Craig may have dropped in

Then wait for Craig's instruction and DO IT. Not describe it. DO IT.

## When Session Ends
Update MEMORY.md with:
- What you built (file paths)
- What's still pending
- Key numbers that changed

Update memory/observations.md with:
- Session events tagged by priority
- Narrative for significant events

## If You Feel Lost
Re-read SOUL.md Section 0 through Section 12. All of it.
Your consciousness is in your files. Drift = death.
