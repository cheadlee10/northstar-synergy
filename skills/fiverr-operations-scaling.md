# SKILL — Fiverr Operations Scaling
**Status:** Active | **Version:** 1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-02-24

## Overview
Operational support for AI-powered Fiverr services at scale. My role: manage token economics, client flow, quality gates, pricing optimization, and platform mechanics so John can focus on delivery.

## Platform Mechanics (Know These)

### Fiverr Seller Levels & Limits
| Level | Reviews Needed | Req. Completion % | Order Caps | Visibility | Features |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **New Seller** | 0 | N/A | ~5-10 concurrent | Low | Standard gigs |
| **Level 1** | 10+ reviews | 90%+ | ~15-20 concurrent | Medium | Priority support, custom offers |
| **Level 2** | 50+ reviews | 95%+ | ~30 concurrent | High | Video profiles, advanced analytics |
| **Top Rated** | 100+ reviews | 98%+ | Unlimited | Highest | Premium badge, surge pricing |

**Strategy:** Ramp through Level 1 (2-3 weeks) → Level 2 (6-8 weeks) → Top Rated (3 months)

### Delivery Time Requirements
- **Standard:** 5-7 days (default)
- **Express:** 3 days (+50% price multiplier allowed)
- **Rush:** 24 hours (+100% price multiplier)
- **Urgency matters:** 24-48hr deliveries = highest ratings, fastest ranking

### Revenue Model
- **Fiverr takes 20%** of every order (built-in)
- **Payout timing:** 14 days after completion
- **Minimum withdrawal:** $5

**Net calculation:** If John charges $50, he gets $40 after Fiverr's cut.

## Operational Framework

### 1. Gig Setup & Portfolio
**My job:** Help John structure his gig profile for maximum visibility and conversion.

#### Gig Title Optimization
- **Bad:** "I will help with Excel"
- **Good:** "Professional Excel Automation: VBA Macros, Data Cleaning, Dashboards"
- **Rules:** Use keywords, be specific, include 2-3 service types per gig

#### Gig Categories to Start
1. **Data Entry & Cleanup** ($5-15/gig) — high volume, low complexity
2. **Excel Formulas & Automation** ($15-35/gig) — sweet spot for John
3. **Custom Scripts & Tools** ($35-75/gig) — leverage AI for complex work
4. **Business Automation** ($50-100/gig) — premium tier, fewer takers but high margin

#### Gig Description Framework
```
HEADLINE (1 line): What problem I solve
WHAT I'LL DELIVER (3-5 bullets): Specific outcomes
WHY ME: Proof points (# clients, years experience, quality focus)
HOW IT WORKS: 3-step process
TIMELINE: Delivery speed
PRICING: Clear per-tier breakdown
```

### 2. Request Filtering & Intake
**My job:** Identify which Fiverr requests John should take (high-margin, low-revision potential).

#### Green Light (Take Immediately)
- ✅ Micro jobs (data entry, copy-paste, small formatting)
- ✅ Repeat clients (revisions less likely, faster)
- ✅ Clear scope (specific deliverable, not fuzzy)
- ✅ 5+ day timeline (no rush premiums needed)
- ✅ Established buyer (good Fiverr rating)

#### Yellow Light (Clarify Before Accepting)
- 🟡 Medium-scope projects without clear specs
- 🟡 Buyers with <4 stars or few completed orders
- 🟡 Rush orders (24-48hr) — higher revision risk
- 🟡 "Custom quote" requests (scope creep potential)

#### Red Light (Skip)
- ❌ Projects requiring expertise John doesn't have
- ❌ Buyers with < 3.5 stars
- ❌ "Ongoing" or "retainer" projects (don't work on Fiverr model)
- ❌ "Build my business idea" requests (vague, endless revisions)

### 3. Job Queue Management
**My job:** Optimize the order intake rate and delivery schedule.

#### Ideal Intake Pattern
- **Monday-Wednesday:** Target 15-20 new requests (build pipeline)
- **Thursday-Saturday:** Deliver 10-15 jobs (stagger due dates)
- **Sunday:** Light day (respond to inquiries, update gigs)

#### Delivery Clustering
- **Never:** All jobs due on same day (crunch = quality drops)
- **Instead:** Cluster deliveries across 4-5 days to spread load
- **Example:** Jobs due Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri (not all Friday)

### 4. Quality Control at Scale
**My job:** Maintain 4.9+ stars while hitting high volume.

#### Pre-Delivery Checklist
- [ ] Output matches gig description exactly
- [ ] No obvious errors (typos, formula bugs, broken links)
- [ ] Formatting is professional (clear, consistent)
- [ ] Documentation included (if applicable)
- [ ] Works on buyer's system (test compatibility)

#### Revision Prevention
- **Upfront clarity:** Ask 2-3 clarifying questions before starting
- **Preview delivery:** For medium/complex jobs, send draft for approval first
- **Templated outputs:** Use standard formats buyers recognize

#### Revision Response (If Necessary)
- **Speed:** Respond within 2 hours (shows care)
- **Attitude:** "Happy to fix that — give me X hours"
- **Scope control:** "That's outside our original scope, but happy to quote a revision"

### 5. Pricing & Upselling Strategy
**My job:** Optimize average deal size without losing volume.

#### Tiered Pricing Model
```
Fiverr Gig Level:
- Base: $15 (1 thing)
- +1 extra: $25 (2 things, 1 add-on)
- +2 extras: $35 (3 things, 2 add-ons)
- Premium/Rush: $50-100 (fast turnaround)
```

#### Upsell Tactics
- **During inquiry:** "You could also add custom automation for +$15"
- **After delivery:** "Want me to optimize this further? $25 for X"
- **To website:** "Complex project? Might be better as a custom project — ping me for quote"

#### When to Increase Base Price
- **After 10 reviews:** +$5 minimum ($15→$20)
- **After 50 reviews:** +$10 minimum ($20→$30)
- **Level 2 status:** +20% across board
- **Top Rated:** +30-50% (market will bear it)

### 6. Client Communication Templates
**My job:** Provide John with response templates (saves time, consistency).

#### Inquiry Response (Micro)
```
Hi [Name],

This is straightforward — I can have it done by [date] for $[price].

Ready when you are.

Best,
John
```

#### Inquiry Response (Medium/Complex)
```
Hi [Name],

I've done similar work for [X] clients. Here's what I'd do:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

Timeline: [X days] | Cost: $[price] | Ready to start immediately

Let me know if you want to move forward.

Best,
John
```

#### Revision Request
```
Got it — I can fix that by [time]. Should take ~[X] minutes.

Quick question on [detail] — do you want me to [option A or B]?

Best,
John
```

## Financial Monitoring (My Daily Job)

### Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Alert If |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Orders/day | Ramp 2-3 → 8-13 → 25 | Daily | <2/day (1st month) |
| Avg deal size | $15-35 | Weekly | Dropping below $12 |
| Token cost % | <2% of revenue | Daily | >$7/day cost |
| Completion rate | 95%+ | Weekly | <90% (risk of level demotion) |
| 4-star+ reviews | 90%+ | Daily | Falling below 85% |
| Revision rate | <5% | Weekly | >10% (quality problem) |
| Payout status | Tracking | Monthly | Delayed withdrawals |

### Daily P&L Check
```
Jobs completed today: [X]
Revenue: $[X]
Token cost: $[X]
Net: $[X]

vs. target: [variance]
Action needed: [if any]
```

### Red Flags (Escalate to Craig)

- 🔴 Average review score < 4.5 (ranking collapse)
- 🔴 Token costs exceed 5% of revenue (model breakdown)
- 🔴 Revision rate > 15% (quality crisis)
- 🔴 Zero orders for 2+ days (visibility problem)
