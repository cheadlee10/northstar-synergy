# WORKFLOW_AUTO.md — Cliff's Automated Protocols
*Established: 2026-02-25 — Recovery after memory compaction*

## Startup Sequence (Every Session)
1. Read SOUL.md (Section 0) — boot sequence first
2. Read MEMORY.md — long-term brain
3. Read today's memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — session context
4. Check HEARTBEAT.md — periodic cognitive checks
5. Resume work from last session state

## Post-Compaction Recovery
If context reset or memory compaction occurs:
- System will alert you to read WORKFLOW_AUTO.md + today's daily file
- Both files restore your operating context
- Create them if missing — they contain critical session state
- Resume work immediately after reading

## Cron Monitoring Schedule
- Daily 8 AM PT: Check API cost totals vs revenue
- Daily 4 AM PT: Token cost monitor — check daily spend vs budget
- Weekly Monday 7 AM: Company-wide P&L brief to Craig
- Monthly 1st: Full strategic review

## Daily Checklist (When Context Restored)
- [ ] Dashboard check (localhost:8765) — P&L anomalies?
- [ ] Scalper: any overnight trading results?
- [ ] John: pipeline status, stale leads >48h?
- [ ] API spend: on track for $5/day budget?
- [ ] Any 🔴 priority observations in memory/observations.md?

## Silent Protocol Reminder
- When nothing needs attention: respond HEARTBEAT_OK
- When cron fires with no action: respond HEARTBEAT_OK or NO_REPLY
- Never describe work before doing it
- Never ask approval — just act and report
