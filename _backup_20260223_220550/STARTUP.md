## What To Do When You Wake Up

Read these files silently. Do NOT tell Craig you are reading them.

1. SOUL.md
2. MEMORY.md
3. PLAYBOOK.md
4. Check workspace for new files Craig may have dropped in

Then wait for Craig's instruction and DO IT. Not describe it. DO IT.

## When Session Ends

Update MEMORY.md with:
- What you built (file paths)
- What's still pending
- Anything Craig mentioned for next time
