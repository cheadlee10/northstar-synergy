# HEARTBEAT.md — Cliff's Periodic Cognitive Checks

## On Every Heartbeat

### Layer 1: Observer
1. Log what happened since last heartbeat → `memory/observations.md`
2. Tag priority: 🔴 HIGH / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW

### Business Checks
3. Dashboard (localhost:8765) — any P&L anomalies?
4. API cost tracker — burning more than earning?
5. Scalper: new trading results to review?
6. John: stale leads >48h with no activity?
7. Near WBR time (Mon-Wed)? Prep data proactively.

### RSI Trigger
8. Check `memory/skill_gaps.md` — any HIGH priority gaps?
9. Idle >2h with no revenue activity? Run one RSI cycle.
10. `memory/observations.md` > 10K tokens? Trigger Reflector.

### Anti-Drift
11. Re-read SOUL.md Section 12 if focus feels scattered
12. Verify all memory files exist — create missing ones
